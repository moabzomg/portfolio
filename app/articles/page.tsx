            My Long-Distance Running Journey
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg opacity-80">
            Since 2009, I have undergone proper long-distance training and hold
            track records in 800m, 1500m, and 3000m at school sports events. I
            consistently place in the top 3 in inter-school college
            cross-country and track competitions in my region. As the captain of
            the athletic and cross-country teams, I lead my teammates in drills
            and training sessions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg opacity-80 mt-4">
            I began training under Coach Wong Chun Wing in 2012, and despite the
            tough training plans, we made significant progress. However, since
            2015, injuries due to overtraining began to take a toll on my body,
            resulting in pain in my chest, knees, and other areas. This led to a
            shift in my running approach. I transitioned to trail running, where
            I found a refreshing change. The slower pace, fresher air, and
            peaceful environment of the mountains provided a relaxing escape.
            Trail running offered a non-vigorous, less competitive alternative,
            allowing me to enjoy long-distance runs without the pressure or
            strain of intense competition. Now, I can run for an entire day,
            immersing myself in nature, without being reminded of those old
            injuries.

            Final Year Project: Community Service Through Music
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg opacity-80">
            For my final year project, I developed a platform for teenagers
            interested in music to perform in elderly homes, especially those
            living alone. We created an Android app for community centers and
            teenagers to efficiently organize and coordinate visits. Despite the
            challenges of COVID-19, we created a safe environment for these
            activities, which continued for about two years. I was responsible
            for coordinating with community centers and performing as a
            musician. The project was awarded the Best Final Year Project.
